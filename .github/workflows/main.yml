# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Package and release

# we need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# this will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# this part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pullrequests.

    tags:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want
  release:
    # we can run our steps on most os images, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets from the project on GitHub
    env:
      CF_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
      WOWI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WOWI_API_TOKEN }}
      WAGO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WAGO_API_TOKEN }}
      GITHUB_OAUTH: ${{ secrets.BUILD_TOKEN }}  # "GITHUB_TOKEN" is a secret always provided to the workflow
                                                 # for your own token, the name cannot start with "GITHUB_"

    # "steps" holds a list of all the steps needed to package and release our AddOn
    steps:

      # we first have to clone the AddOn project, this is a required step
      - name: Clone project
        uses: actions/checkout@v1  # note: checkout@v2 breaks git history, so generating a changelog and
                                   # file naming for non-tagged builds will not work properly

      # once cloned, we just run the GitHub Action for the packager project
      - name: Package and release
